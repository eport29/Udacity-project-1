## Project Motivation

For my first project, I was interestested in using the Black Friday Dataset from Kaggle to better understand who made up  the majority of the shoppers.Furthermore, is there a correlation between the product types and purchases? Answering these questions can better inform stores in how to prepare for next year's Black Friday by appealing to the group of people who do not shop during this event. 

Questions that will be investigated:
1: What is the gender and age distribution?
2: What is the purchase amount across age?
3: Is there a correlation between the product type, age, occupation, marital status on purchase?

## File descriptions
Includes a jupyter notebook and its HTML form.

CSV file of the dataset is a sample of the transactions made from a retail store. Objective of the store  was to better understand customer purchase behaviour against different products. 
12 variables include:

User_ID, 
Product_ID, 
Gender, 
Age, 
Occupation, 
City_Category, 
Stay_In_Current_City_Years, 
Marital_Status, 
Product_Category_1- Cloths, 
Product_Category_2- Electronics,
