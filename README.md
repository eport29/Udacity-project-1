## Results
Throughout the notebook, I sought to answer three  general questions:

Questions that pertain to the new coders such as language 

How is the self-care of the individual 

Which programming language has the highest job satisfaction?

Data showed:

JavaScript, C#, Java, SQL and Python are the most used languages by professional developers and therefore would be the most in demand and transferable skill between jobs. To support this, the most used frameworks are mostly JavaScript based. Agile is also the most popular methodology used by professional developers.

Languages that are known and used by less professionals warrant higher salaries.

Those who use less popular languages have higher job satisfaction but this may be a correlation between salary and job satisfaction.
